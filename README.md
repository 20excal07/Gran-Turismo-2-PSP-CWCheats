# Gran Turismo 2 PSP CWCheat codes
CWCheat codes to slightly improve your GT2 experience on the PSP via POPS emulation.

Some codes are based on CookiePLMonster's work: <br />
**https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/Console-Cheat-Codes/**

Codes that were based on his work will be marked in the cheat file with `[CPLM]`. Credits go to him. :)

The ones I share here are the ones that I managed to get working without crashing the PSP.<br />
Feel free to fork this and add more.

These codes will work with the **v1.2 NTSC-U Simulation** disc.<br />
If you've patched the game with the [**GT2 Plus**](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/mod-gran-turismo-2-plus-bug-fixes-restored-content-and-new-content.378282/) mod using any of the NTSC-U disc as a base, it is automatically upgraded to v1.2 and will work with that.

**It will NOT work with the NTSC-U Arcade disc**, patched or not, because that disc only goes up to v1.1.
